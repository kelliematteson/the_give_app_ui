The Give App

The Idea: During the Pandemic there have been a few things that have kept me sane and given me some joy, The Buy Nothing FaceBook Group has been one of those things. This is a location dependent group. You join the Buy Nothing Group in your neighborhood and you begin posting - things you no longer have use for, things you think would have value to others, extra cookies you need to get rid of. You name it, you can probably find it. Buy Nothing and Give Freely. You help reduce useless purchases, give to your neighbors and receive gratefully.  I want to help turn this into an app.

User Case Stories: User X got a new dining room table and has no room for her old one. It has a lot of life left so she goes to The Give, creates a profile, is now able to make a post offering up this table. She logs back in later in the day to see that 6 people in the neighborhood have added themselves to the list to request the item. User X can do one of two things- use a randomizer function to pick the winner or read over their individual pleas and decided who to give it to. She chooses User Y and sends him an email to arrange prompt pick up.

The Give App will have full crud capability. The user will be able to post new gives, update their give, delete their give once someone has agreed to take it. There will be Authentication so the each user will have a password and a secure account to check and see how many bids they've received on their gives. The App will have the option of a randomizer function to select a winner. Eventually, the app will sort you into the correct neighborhood group. Important because this is about fostering community with your immediate neighbors.
